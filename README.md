# Email_Classification
Deciding which class an email belongs to, spam or not spam is a classification problem. Solving this requires the use of supervised machine learning. Our dataset is a collection of emails that have already been labeled as spam or ham. Our model will learn to classify an email as spam or not depending on the contents of the email.<br>
This project utilizes the Bernoulli Naive Bayes and logistic regression algorithm.
